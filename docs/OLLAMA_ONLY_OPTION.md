# Ollama-Only Processing Option

## Overview

This document explores using **Ollama for both transcription and summarization**, eliminating the faster-whisper dependency.

## Current Architecture (v0.4)

```
Audio → faster-whisper (transcription) → Ollama (summarization) → Markdown
```

**Dependencies:**
- faster-whisper
- Ollama API

## Proposed Ollama-Only Architecture

```
Audio → Ollama (multimodal LLM) → Combined transcript/summary → Markdown
```

**Dependencies:**
- Ollama API only

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Use Whisper via Ollama API

While Ollama doesn't run Whisper directly, you can:

1. Keep Whisper separate for transcription (current approach)
2. Use Ollama only for summarization (already implemented!)

**This is the recommended approach and what v0.4 already does.**

### Option 2: Use Speech-to-Text LLM via Ollama

Some newer LLMs have audio understanding capabilities. However, as of 2025:

- Most Ollama models are text-only
- Audio/multimodal support is limited
- Transcription accuracy would be lower than Whisper
- Processing would be much slower

### Option 3: Hybrid - Audio Chunks via LLM Prompting

Send audio in chunks to a text-only LLM with timestamps, and ask it to:
1. Transcribe the audio content
2. Summarize the meeting
3. Extract action items

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Much less accurate than Whisper
- ❌ Significantly slower
- ❌ May not understand all audio
- ❌ Requires very large context window

## Recommendation

**Stick with the current v0.4 architecture:**

```yaml
# Current (RECOMMENDED)
Transcription: faster-whisper (GPU-accelerated, accurate)
Summarization: Ollama (flexible, multiple models)
```

**Why?**
1. **Best accuracy**: Whisper is purpose-built for transcription
2. **Performance**: Whisper with GPU is very fast (~1-2 min for 30-min meeting)
3. **Reliability**: Dedicated transcription models vs general LLMs
4. **Already implemented**: v0.4 uses Ollama for summarization

## Alternative: Simplify Dependencies Further

If your goal is to reduce dependencies, consider:

### Option: Local Whisper.cpp + Ollama

Replace faster-whisper with whisper.cpp for transcription:

**Benefits:**
- No Python ML dependencies
- Smaller binary
- Still GPU-accelerated
- Still very accurate

**Changes needed:**
```python
# Instead of faster-whisper
import subprocess

def transcribe_with_whisper_cpp(audio_file):
    result = subprocess.run([
        "./whisper.cpp",
        "-m", "models/ggml-base.bin",
        "-f", str(audio_file)
    ], capture_output=True)
    return result.stdout.decode()
```

## True Ollama-Only Implementation (Not Recommended)

If you really want Ollama-only despite the trade-offs:

```python
# src/ollama_transcriber.py
import requests
from pathlib import Path

def transcribe_with_ollama(audio_file: Path, model: str = "llama3:8b"):
    """
    Attempt transcription using LLM prompting (NOT RECOMMENDED).

    Note: This will be much less accurate than Whisper.
    """
    # Read audio file
    import base64
    audio_data = base64.b64encode(audio_file.read_bytes()).decode()

    prompt = f"""I have an audio recording of a meeting. Please:
1. Transcribe the audio content
2. Include timestamps where possible
3. Summarize the key points

Audio data (base64): {audio_data[:100]}...

Please provide the transcription:"""

    response = requests.post(
        f"{OLLAMA_ENDPOINT}/api/generate",
        json={
            "model": model,
            "prompt": prompt,
            "stream": False
        }
    )

    return response.json().get("response")
```

**Why this doesn't work well:**
- LLMs can't actually "hear" audio without multimodal training
- Base64 audio data is meaningless to text-only models
- Would need a true audio-understanding model
- Much slower and less accurate

## Conclusion

**The current v0.4 architecture is optimal:**

✅ Whisper for transcription (best accuracy, fast with GPU)
✅ Ollama for summarization (flexible, already configured)
✅ Server-first with local fallback (reliable)
✅ Hybrid processing mode (smart routing)

**You're already using Ollama for everything it's good at!** The system uses:
- Whisper: For what it's best at (audio → text)
- Ollama: For what it's best at (text → summary)

This separation of concerns is the right architectural choice.

## If You Want to Simplify Further

The only meaningful simplification would be:

**Option: Remove the server entirely, keep local-only**

```yaml
# config.yaml
processing:
  mode: local  # Never use server

# This gives you:
# - Zero network dependencies
# - All processing local
# - Still uses Whisper (accurate) + Ollama (flexible)
# - Slower but fully offline
```

This is already supported in v0.4! Just set `mode: local`.
